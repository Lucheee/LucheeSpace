Lucheespace is all about self love

Self-love can be extremely difficult to come by. I discovered that my self-love & confidence came from fashion and web development.

My message for my fashion blog is to encourage everyone to dress in whatever you want, whatever makes you feel empowered & yourself. I encourage everyone to try that funky outfit & go out of your comfort zone. I want to help share tips & ideas that you can put into your own lifestyle to fit you. I want everyone to experience that confidence we all deserve to have.

I hope my blog does all these things & more for you. Let's boost our confidence & love ourselves fully. Even if itâ€™s one day at a time.
