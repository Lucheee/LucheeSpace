<div class="about">
  <p>I am a 22 year old from Lagos, Nigeria. I am currently enrolled in Altschool Africa studying Backend Engineering(Python).

</p>

<p>Self-love can be extremely difficult to come by. I discovered that my self-love & confidence came from fashion and web development.
</p>
  <p> My message for my fashion blog is to encourage everyone to dress in whatever you want, whatever makes you feel empowered & yourself. I encourage everyone to try that funky outfit & go out of your comfort zone. I want to help share tips & ideas that you can put into your own lifestyle to fit you. I want everyone to experience that confidence we all deserve to have.
</p>
<p>

I hope my blog does all these things & more for you. Let's boost our confidence & love ourselves fully. Even if itâ€™s one day at a time.
